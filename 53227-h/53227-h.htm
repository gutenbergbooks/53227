<p>As will be seen elsewhere, our new missionaries arrived at Freetown, Sierra Leone,
March 23d, just one month from the date of their leaving New York by steamer for
England. They had only the ordinary discomforts of a sea voyage, and reached their
destination in good condition. Their first impressions of the new field seem to be
quite favorable, and their desire to be to enter on the new work at once. We look to
the Lord of the harvest for His blessing on the lives and labors of all those who have
gone from us to the Mendi Mission.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We read with unfeigned regret of the disasters and delays which the <a name="Err_1" id="Err_1"></a>English and
Scotch missionaries have met with, in attempting to begin their new work in Central
Africa. The expedition of the London Missionary Society was, from July to January
last, trying to push its way with its supplies to its destination on Lake Tanganyika,
but was obliged to encamp for the rainy season at Kirasa, only about one-third of the
way. It is hoped that during the present year they may reach the lake, and establish
themselves there. The mission of the Free and United Presbyterian Churches is in
danger of being driven from its station at Livingstonia, on Lake Nyanza, by so insignificant
an enemy as a fly. The bite of the tsetse, deadly to all domestic animals, has
sadly impoverished them, impeded their industrial operations, and curtailed their
usefulness in advancing the civilization of Africa. The station may have to be
moved. A new site must be sought with great care, which will not be liable to this
pest.</p>

<p>In South Africa another missionary institution has been endangered by the Caffre
War, three English officials having been murdered not far away; while missionaries Smith
and O’Neill, of the Church Missionary Society in Central Africa, have been killed
by hostile natives, on their way back to Uganda, the capital of King M’tesa. We
believe that our forces at Good Hope and Avery are not liable to any of these perils.
The station is accessible and reached; no deadly venom is in the insect life around
them, nor are there unfriendly nations near. Only the dangers common to such regions
are there to threaten them. And yet we must not set our hopes too high, or base
them too confidently on any of the uncertainties which the future still holds. In a land
of delays we know not what may hinder; amid a thousand possibilities, we cannot tell
what peril lurks. Our hope is in the Lord&mdash;that He will suffer no evil to befall them,
but give them strength for patient continuance in well-doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Our friends at Talladega College miss their names from the Institutions we mentioned
in the May <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, as needing greatly, and at once, enlarged accommodations. We
did not mention their wants, as indeed we did not other important needs; and perhaps the
reason was, as they suggest, because, appreciating the strain laid upon our resources this
year, they have considerately refrained from pressing the case which, last year, they laid
before us. They say “It is difficult for us to see how any institutions in the South can
be in more pressing need than we of a new dormitory.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Whidby’s fears that a colored delegate to the Atlanta Sunday-school Convention
would be either “lionized or snubbed” to that extent that it would be better for him
not to come, proved to be not well grounded. The warned man did not come; but,
fortunately, another did, of similar complexion, and that from Texas. He was received
and treated just as the others were, and he behaved as well. The fact is, they were
much busier devising for Sunday-school work than applying a color metre to each
other’s faces. We are very glad the Texas brother was there.</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLES AND PLANS.</h3>

<p>&mdash;This Association does not affirm that races, any more than individuals, are equal
in physical or mental fibre and development. Some races, as well as individuals, are
manifestly below others in some respects. All that we claim is, that all men shall be
regarded as equal <em>before God and the Law</em>; and that hence, in all churches of Christ,
no distinction be made, on account of race or color; and also that, in the enactment and
administration of the laws of the land, all races be equally protected in person and
property, and that whatever immunities or privileges are granted to one, be extended
to all.</p>

<p>&mdash;This Association does not found exclusively colored churches. They are only exclusive
because they are not exclusive. They are open to all races, and hence but few
white persons unite with them. But, while the work of the Association has been principally
among the colored people in the South, as being at present most accessible, yet
it has always favored the establishment of churches, mainly white, where the distribution
of population calls for them, and which allow colored persons freely to unite with
them. Thus, the early efforts of John G. Fee, its first missionary in the South, was in
the formation of white churches in Kentucky. So, also, the counsel of its officers was
sought and given in the organization of the Second (or white) Congregational Church
in Chattanooga, Tenn. Its first minister was Rev. J. A. Thome, a life-long friend
of the A. M. A., and at one time its agent in Great Britain. The Congregational
Church in Jacksonville, Fla., was organized, and its house dedicated, under the
auspices of Rev. C. L. Woodworth, its Boston Secretary, who spent a month in
Jacksonville preaching and laboring for that purpose. Not long since, the Association
appointed a missionary in Kentucky, who has surveyed the field in the vicinity
of Berea College, and expects to organize five or six churches, to which he will
preach in turn until each can sustain a minister. These will be mainly white churches,
but open to colored people. In like manner, the Association has promised missionary
aid to a church, of similar character, about to be organized in San Antonio,
Texas.</p>

<p>&mdash;The educational institutions of the A. M. A. in the South are in order to its religious
work in America and Africa. Its best and most promising churches are established
near the schools and colleges, and receive intelligence and strength from them.
These schools furnish hundreds of Christian teachers, who instruct thousands of pupils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in day and Sunday-schools, and carry a salutary influence into the homes, churches and
neighborhoods where they reside. The schools and theological departments also send
out many ministers and missionaries, who carry the Gospel to their people in the
South and in Africa.</p>

<p>&mdash;The work of the Association is a providential growth, each part having a relation
to the whole, and its plans, while at present embracing mainly the “Despised
Races,” as they have been called, are restricted in principle to no race or continent.</p>

<h3>DEPARTURE OF THE “AZOR.”</h3>

<p>The departure of the <i>Azor</i> with the first instalment of the African exodus, from
Charleston, S. C., marks an epoch in the history of the colored race.</p>

<p>It may have been a question in some minds whether the freedman could be aroused
by the missionary spirit. By some, even of the teachers in our schools, fears have been
felt that, perhaps, the call for missionaries might come and the people not be ready to
respond. The question is decided that, whenever this call shall be made, there will be
no lack of men. We have more to fear now from unbridled enthusiasm than from want
of zeal.</p>

<p>This African Exodus Association had its origin, undoubtedly, among disaffected
politicians, but it soon became a sort of religious crusade. It gained but little progress
among the people, until the idea was suggested that it be made a missionary enterprise.
From the time the <i>Azor</i> sailed into the harbor until her departure, on the 21st of April,
with her living freight for Liberia, the wharves and streets of the city were thronged
with people of all sexes and ages, eager to view the African “Mayflower.” Hundreds, who
had engaged their passages months before, were left behind, for want of room. How
long this enthusiasm will continue, and what may be the success of this first company, of
course are questions to be answered by and by. We dare not venture any prophecy,
either good or evil. It is an experiment, some features of which are not in the line of
our ideas; but if, in the providence of God, it shall prove to be to Africa what the Pilgrim
enterprise has been to America, we shall rejoice. We should prefer to have a
different class of emigrants undertake this work, and lay the foundation of African
civilization upon a broader foundation. Our object is to raise up men of intelligence,
and sound and broad religious principle, for this work, and we naturally look with some
anxiety to the effect of turning loose in Africa the freedman, as we find him in the South
at present. We hope for the best, however, and shall pray for the success of the movement,
that God may overrule all our fears, and make it for good. This one question we
are glad to have settled, as we think it is by this movement, that there is no lack of enthusiasm
in the negro heart for his fatherland; and that, when the call shall come for
more laborers in that field, we shall have this enthusiasm on our side.</p>

<h3>THE INDIAN BOYS AT HAMPTON.</h3>

<p>Visitors to St. Augustine, Fla., during the last three years have been directed to Capt.
Pratt’s Indians as among the objects of interest in Fort Marion. There they were carried,
as prisoners of war, in the spring of 1875, after the terrible massacres which had
taken place in the Indian Territory by the Five Tribes. They went South, each with his
legs fastened to a log with chains. They were filled with hatred over their real or fancied
wrongs. One jumped from the cars, and was shot by the guard; one killed himself
on the way. They wore only their Indian blankets, and had great brass hoops in
their ears. They knew no word of English. It was their good fortune to fall into the
hands of a Christian army officer, who, by his skill in management, and patience in seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to do them good, at length won their confidence, and succeeded, with the help of
a few benevolent ladies, in teaching them some of the simplest elements of civilization
and learning. A few of them can read very well.</p>

<p>At the end of their second year, Mrs. Dr. Caruthers, of Tarrytown, N. Y., who had
been teaching among them, determined to secure, if possible, the education of two young
men of her class. She obtained permission from the Indian Commission, and raised
money for the purpose. Other means and offers of help came in. At length it was
found that twenty-two of them desired to go to school. They are now discharged from
their imprisonment. The old chiefs go back to their people, greatly changed for the
better. Fifteen of the young men were left at Hampton, April 13th, to be educated in
the Normal Institute. They have begun their regular studies, and have been detailed to
various departments of work, in shop and on farm. They seem perfectly happy and contented,
and their new comrades treat them with kindness and consideration.</p>

<p>Here is another of those curious comminglings, and crossings of lines, of which life is
so full, and yet which never cease to surprise us. The African and the Indian meet at
Hampton, to be trained together, to be intelligent citizens and Christians, and the teachers
of their people. Thus the two races are brought face to face&mdash;“the two races whose
past involves America’s greatest responsibilities; whose future, some of her hardest
problems.”</p>

<p>It costs $115 to keep one of these Indian boys at Hampton for a year&mdash;that,
with what he is able to earn by his labor. This amount has been pledged by individuals
alone, or together, for the education of most of the number. Mrs. Caruthers, having
done so much, has asked the A. M. A., through its President and its Secretary, to assume
the tuition of one of her wards, and the Executive Committee desire to do so;
and Zone-ke-nh, twenty-one years of age, of the Kiowa tribe, will go to Hampton, in
addition to those already there, as the pupil of the Association, if some of our friends,
who may be especially interested in the elevation of the Indians, will make up this small
amount, and help on this work, in which the elements are combined of romance, beneficence,
and personality.</p>

<h3>A SUNDAY-SCHOOL CONCERT.</h3>

<p>Nothing is more welcome in these days than new ideas for use in Sunday-schools.
What to do with the Concert, has been a question which has perplexed teachers and
superintendents year after year, as the months come, one after another, in rapid succession.
The verses containing “faith” and “hope” and “heaven” must be nearly all
learned now in some quarters, and the new suggestion is, try a Missionary Concert, or,
if you please, an American Missionary Concert.</p>

<p>But, how shall it be done? The answer is at hand. The pattern, even, can be sent,
like Demorest’s or Butterick’s, in paper and by mail. We have one in our hands, about
six inches by eight, four pages. It consists of a series of questions and answers (prepared
originally by Rev. A. E. Winship, of Somerville, Mass.) upon the nature and the
work of the A. M. A., and we are almost surprised to find so much valuable and exact
information compacted in this form, and in so taking and interesting a shape. Coupled
with this is a small sheet collection of eight or ten Jubilee Songs, to be sung at intervals
during the Catechetical Exercise. We hear that this exercise has been used with great
interest and success in several Sunday-schools at and near Boston; and we commend, most
cordially, the thought and plan to the consideration and use of Superintendents and
Presidents of Missionary Societies. The twenty-sixth article in the programme is a
collection, and a legend instructing generous youth how to address their gifts to us.
A new edition is in preparation, or in press. The questions and songs may be obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in quantity, on application to District Secretary Woodworth, at the Congregational
House, Boston.</p>

<p>District Secretary Powell has issued recently, from Chicago, an appeal to the Sunday-schools
in behalf of the “Colored Student’s Aid Fund.” He says: “It is estimated
that we are reaching (by student and graduate teachers) not less than a hundred thousand
children in the South. But there are two millions of them to be reached.” He
urges every Sunday-school to help in this good work. To know, is the first step toward
supplying the want.</p>

<div class="article">

<h3>AN EDUCATED MINISTRY.</h3>

<p>It is quite remarkable that the uneducated ministers among the colored people of
the South should be in such earnest sympathy with the work of educating their people.
Occasionally, we hear one intimate that he is a trumpet for the Lord to “toot”
through, and express fear that the tone of the instrument might be injured by the
application of science; but the expression of such sentiments is rare.</p>

<p>In the dark days, when States did not allow people of a certain color to read, or
any one to teach them, preachers were <em>born</em>, not <em>made</em>. The wether of the flock put a
bell around his own neck, and led off. As the Indian who could bring home from the
war-path the most scalps, or from the hunt the greatest amount of venison or furs, was
the man for chief; so the exhorter who could pick up the most texts of Scripture, and
evolve from his own understanding the greatest amount of rhetoric, and with arrows of
his own manufacture pierce the largest number of souls, was the minister by universal
consent.</p>

<p>Schools do not make brains; they only develop and bring out what Nature implanted
in a man. Leaders by the voice of God need not fear those made leaders by
the voice of a theological seminary. They who, by their quickness of perception, tact
and experience, control men, need not fear that those who depend chiefly upon ability
gained from books will steal the hearts of their people.</p>

<p>Now, in saying all this, as the expression of my own thoughts, as well as the felt sentiments
of the uneducated ministers among the colored people, I have no intention of
placing a low estimate upon the schools. These uncultured giants might have attained
to a larger growth, if they had been supplied with good mental nourishment, and no one
feels this more than they. The <span class="medium">BEST</span> minister combines natural ability of a high order
with liberal culture. The tendency of the times is toward an educated ministry; and
although the present pastors of the flocks may be secure in their places without learning,
the next generation will insist upon education in their ministers.</p>

<h3>ATLANTA AND FISK UNIVERSITIES.</h3>

<p>A recent visit to these institutions has resulted in some observations, which may be
worthy of record. The location of both is unsurpassed. In these cities Atlanta and
Fisk Universities occupy, respectively, two of the most commanding and beautiful sites.
They are seen from afar, a perpetual reminder of the importance of the work they represent.
The buildings of both institutions are good; Jubilee Hall surpassingly so. Our
party approached it late in the evening, when it was lighted from top to bottom, as the
students were studying in their rooms. “Hallelujah!” cried one of our number,
enthusiastically, “God be praised for this great lighthouse in the South.” And not one
of us looked upon it without emotion.</p>

<p>The teachers in both institutions are among the choicest of educated Christian
people. A more intelligent, cultivated and consecrated body of instructors it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
hard to find. They are doing their work at much personal sacrifice. Their social privileges
in both cities are few or none at all, and some of them, for the sake of the work
they are in, have refused tempting offers from Northern schools. They are teaching the
colored race from a high sense of duty, and are filled with a missionary enthusiasm in
their work. Often did the eye flash and the face glow, as they spoke of the trials and
advancement of their pupils.</p>

<p>The students in these institutions are, of course, the flower of the colored race.
Only those are likely to undertake so many years of study, with the self-denials involved,
who have, to begin with, tolerably clear ideas of the privileges of an education, and
in whom are unusual elements of character. They are procuring an education under
great difficulties. There are few to encourage them or aid them. But they are eager to fit
themselves for future usefulness, and burdened with a longing to help their race. They
work, therefore, with an enthusiasm needing little urging or government. It is not
strange, then, that when both teacher and scholar are fired with a religious fervor, the
results should be unusually favorable.</p>

<p>Among these results in both institutions, the good order is specially noticeable. At
the table, where teachers and scholars eat together, all stand quietly till the teacher in
charge takes his seat. There is no loud talking or laughing, but, while no restraints
are put on conversation, only a gentle murmur of voices, which does not prevent the
slightest signal from being heard. The least tap of a bell suffices to dismiss the hundred
or more boarders from the tables. In passing through the school-room at Fisk
University, we noticed that no teacher was present, though perfect order was maintained.
“Have you no instructor or monitor here,” we asked, “to secure good order?”
“Why, no, sir,” one replied, wonderingly, “we do not wish to be disorderly.” We could
but recall certain days of our own student life when, if our instructor chanced to step
out of the room for a moment, there were instantly missiles flying about, and students
darting here and there.</p>

<p>There is a striking degree of refinement among the students. They impress one at a
glance as ladies and gentlemen. There is nothing about them, in dress, or manner or
language, to offend the most fastidious. Never was there a better illustration than at
these institutions of the power of a Christian education to change the whole character
and appearance. A cultivated soul shines out from these dark faces, and, in our admiration
for the soul, we totally forget the color of the skin.</p>

<p>The education of these students is rapidly progressing. We must remember that
most of them were born in slavery, and have learned to read since the war. A generation
or two must pass before we can see the results of life-long training in schools.
What we now see, however, is sufficiently surprising. It would be hard to find at the
North better teachers or better schools than the two Universities of which we speak;
and their influence over the pupils is marvelous. Many of the recitations were very
fine. The normal training of Fisk University seemed to deserve special commendation.
We were also much pleased at a recitation in Xenophon’s <cite>Memorabilia</cite>, in
which three young men were reciting to one of their own race, a graduate of the
University&mdash;Miss Laura S. Cary. It would not be strange if this were the first instance
of the kind in the history of the world. Perhaps a more valuable evidence of
educational progress than recitations was the correctness of speech and richness of
thought manifest in the conversations and remarks of the students. We were permitted
to be present at a prayer-meeting, in which students of both sexes took part
freely. There are few pastors in the North who would not be glad of such clear
thought and apt expression in their meetings as we there heard.</p>

<p><a name="Err_2" id="Err_2"></a>The discipline of these institutions is evidently giving the pupils rare qualities of
earnestness and self-reliance. Undoubtedly those who have these qualities inborn are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the ones who are most likely to be in the schools. But once in the course of study, all
the influences tend to develop a manly and persevering spirit. The students are accustomed
every summer to scatter through the South, in search of schools. These, in
most of the States, they do not find ready to their hand. There are few organized
schools and few school-houses for the colored people outside the cities. The University
students desirous of a school must first hunt up children who will agree to come; then
secure the use of some little colored church at the cross-roads, or, perhaps, of a vacant
log-cabin; then they must obtain permission of the county commissioner to teach the
school. It evidently requires courage and resolution to succeed under such circumstances,
and yet these students earn every summer, in from three to five months of
teaching, about a hundred dollars apiece. Sometimes parents are willing and able to
educate their children, without throwing them thus on their own resources. After
Fisk University was established, a colored man bought land near by, built him a comfortable
house, and made his home there, with the express purpose of educating his
large family of children. But such cases are rare. The youth who desire an education
generally are obliged to secure the means themselves. We were much touched
with the story of one young lady (as truly so as any in our Northern seminaries), who,
at the age of fourteen, determined to go to Fisk University, and went to teaching till
she had earned the means. For five years she has been securing an education, paying
her way by teaching every summer. Another student was pointed out to us, whose persistence
under difficulties is still more remarkable. For the work of two successive
summers, he has been unable to collect a dollar of the money due him; and for last
summer’s work, when he was able to get a school that would pay only half the average
sum, he has as yet received only a small portion of what he has earned. And yet
he is not discouraged, but works on cheerfully. At Fisk University, Mrs. A. K. Spence
is making efforts to secure gifts from Sabbath-schools in the North, to supplement the
meagre sums earned by the students. One hundred and fifty dollars annually will carry
a student through. (We heard a gentleman say that it cost his son a thousand dollars
a year at a Northern college.) If any Sabbath-school desires to assume the additional
fifty dollars for the support of one of these pupils, Mrs. Spence will be glad to receive
a letter on the subject. The great trouble is to induce the students to receive aid.
They are eager to do for themselves. Recently, some kind words were addressed
them by a visitor, on the subject of self-reliance. “Oh,” said one of the teachers,
“it is a pity he said that; it was natural he should, but he does not know
them. It made them wince, and we shall have harder work than ever to persuade
them to receive the help they need.”</p>

<p>We were greatly pleased at the piety of the students in both institutions. Most of
them, particularly among the boarders, are earnest and consistent Christians. We
were much moved at some of their prayers, they were so tender, earnest and child-like.
The prayer of one of their number is still treasured up in the memory of the instructors.
Jubilee Hall had just been completed. It seemed a paradise to the colored
people. A farewell meeting was held in the old dingy barracks, in the centre of Nashville,
where the school had hitherto met. It was then that one of the students prayed&mdash;“O
Lord, Thou knowest how eager we are to enter this beautiful new building; but if
Thou wilt not go with us, we do not wish to go. Unless Thou wilt go, also, let us stay
here.” The Lord did go with them, and they have enjoyed frequent seasons of revival
ever since.</p>

<p>The aims of these students are very high. They justly feel that the elevation of
nearly five millions of people rests largely on them. They have a worthy ambition to
be the leaders of their race in everything pure and noble. Conjoined with this, a new
ambition has recently fired their hearts. The four students who have just gone from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Fisk University to Africa have left behind them an enthusiasm for missionary work.
The students are now praying and planning for the conversion of Africa by missionaries
of their own color. There is nothing that so lifts up a people as a definite and high
aim. These students justly feel that in this land, and abroad, there is work for them
to do. A glorious future lies within their reach, and the fact stimulates them to faithful
study and gives them Christian manliness, as could nothing else.</p>

<p>It was a grief to us to learn that a shadow of financial anxiety hung over Fisk
University. Funds that were relied upon from Great Britain for current expenses had
failed, and retrenchment, where expenses had already been cut down to the quick, was
under consideration. Surely the friends of this noble Institution will not let it suffer.</p>

<h3>NEWS FROM THE CHURCHES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Hampton, Va.</span>&mdash;Four students received to the church by profession May 5th. One
of the Indian students lately received gives evidence of Christian character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Raleigh, N. C.</span>&mdash;“Our church has shared with others in a revival blessing this spring.”
Twenty were received to the church April 8th, which now numbers 72. Mr. Smith, the
pastor, writes: “There are several of the young men connected with our church and
school who are anxious that I should teach them theology. I think, if I can get some
simple, cheap work on that subject, that I will form them into a class, and have them
recite two or three times a week. I want to do all I can to help the young men on.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orangeburg, S. C.</span>&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. W. L. Johnson have been two years in this
church and school. The church membership has increased two-thirds. Two members
received in April. Sunday-school thriving and increasing, and feeding the church. A
Woman’s Foreign Missionary Association is organized, and has contributed to the A. M.
A. debt, and missions in India and Africa. Fifteen have been in training for teachers
this year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Byron, Ga.</span>&mdash;“The church is active; Sunday-school increasing in numbers steadily.
A day-school will soon be opened. Young people are asking for prayers every Sunday
evening.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Savannah, Ga.</span>&mdash;One of the workers in Savannah writes: “Our church work is very
encouraging. The Sabbath-school is splendid. I have twenty boys from twelve to sixteen
years of age in my class, and am deeply interested in them. Never before, since I
have been here, has the church been so prosperous.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion, Ala.</span>&mdash;The Sabbath audiences are steadily increasing. Three or four are to
unite with the church at the next Communion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence, Ala.</span>&mdash;Mr. L. C. Anderson reports the attendance on church services
good, and one member received on profession at his last visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbeville, La.</span>&mdash;The church has been holding special meetings, crowded every night.
Two have been received to membership; others are under deep conviction. Rev.
Charles E. Smith is the pastor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Memphis, Tenn.</span>&mdash;A genuine interest is manifested in the teachings of God’s word,
and a higher standard of personal godliness sought. “The question, how to utilize the
combined power of the Church for its own unification and enlargement, is discussed in
the prayer-meetings with growing frequency, and manifestly deepening interest. The
church has passed in safety and triumph through its financial straits, deficiencies have
been made up, current expenses provided for, and a small surplus is on hand for the
summer demands.”</p>

<h3>ITEMS FROM THE SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Charleston, S. C.</span>&mdash;The Avery Normal Institute held its thirteenth anniversary
April 17th. The school numbers 294. The pupils were examined in Natural Philosophy,
Grammar, Arithmetic, Botany, Physiology, Spelling, Mental Arithmetic, History,
Latin, Grammatical Analysis, Reading, Geography, Algebra, Writing, etc.; and an
exhibition was held the following day, with music and recitations, to the great delight of
a large assembly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Macon, Ga.</span>&mdash;The school building was dedicated, with the chapel, March 24. There
are three rooms occupying the ground floor of the building. The large one will seat
110 pupils; the smaller, or recitation-rooms, twenty-five or thirty each. The whole
building is lighted with gas and heated by a furnace. Mr. Harrington writes:&mdash;“We
are credited by the people of the city&mdash;by the white people, especially&mdash;with having
the prettiest chapel and school-rooms in the State.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Forsyth, Ga.</span>&mdash;School-house built last year&mdash;“a two-story building, without a
chimney, plastering, or even laths.” Occupied since February last. Attendance good.
“A deep concern about the most familiar truths of the Bible has led to a short lecture
every morning,” by Mr. Jackson, the teacher. That the young people can only stay
in school two or three months at a time, is the greatest drawback. The white people
are very kind, and respond generously to every call for aid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuthbert, Ga.</span>&mdash;There has been going on for over two weeks a glorious revival.
Nearly all the pupils of the school are converted; all of the highest class but one, and
that one an inquirer. Three ministers are attending school regularly. A reading-room
has been opened. Mr. Wright divides his efforts between the two (Methodist and
Baptist) Sunday-schools of the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fort Valley, Ga.</span>&mdash;The day-school is improving by degrees. The Sunday-school
is growing rapidly. The cold weather has prevented many from coming out, but the
prospect is that very soon the school will be crowded. A small sum is in hand, with
which to purchase catechisms and lesson-papers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Orleans, La.</span>&mdash;“The year has been in every way delightful and profitable.
God has blessed us in every department of our work. Every month, and indeed every
week, has brought some new expression of the Divine favor. Upon our catalogue,
soon to be issued, between 280 and 300 names will appear, and they represent as good a
class of students as were ever gathered in the University. So much for numerical success.
What is better, there has been entire harmony and affectionate co-operation in
the Faculty.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mobile, Ala., Emerson Institute.</span>&mdash;The new two-story brick building, 34×64,
with wings 10×21, was dedicated May 1st with exercises of great interest. A full

<h3>GENERAL NOTES.</h3>

<h4>The Negro.</h4>

<p>&mdash;We were misled by a usually reliable authority in regard to the income of the
Peabody Educational Fund. In 1866, its trustees distributed, in eight States, $35,400;
in 1873, in ten States, $137,150; and in 1877, $89,400. We give the figures from their
report, and take the largest and smallest.</p>

<p>&mdash;April 21st, the barque <i>Azor</i> sailed from Charleston, S. C., with 250 emigrants,
one-fifth being children. They go under the auspices of the Liberian Exodus Association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to Boporo, about sixty miles north-east from Monrovia. It is intended to purchase
a steamship to make regular trips to Monrovia. A reporter from the Charleston <cite>News
and Courier</cite> accompanies the <i>Azor</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mr. Orcutt, General Secretary of the American Colonization Society, writes that
vessels will sail under their auspices in June and November. He fears for the new exodus
movement, as having more zeal than knowledge; and remarks that, “at the very
outset, they were subjected to disappointments and annoyances, which evinced the need
of a competent controlling agency in the management of their affairs.”</p>

<p>&mdash;A meeting of colored men was held at Washington, a few weeks ago, to organize
a colony for the West, and measures were taken to promote that object. They denounced
the Liberian exodus.</p>

<p>&mdash;Senator Ingalls has written a letter, in which he promises to all the colored people
who may choose to emigrate thither, a cordial welcome to Kansas, the protection
of her laws, and equal facilities for education.</p>

<p>&mdash;“We starve and pinch the American Missionary Association, giving little more
than $200,000 a year towards founding Christian schools, and planting Christian pulpits,
among four million freedmen, in the pit of ignorance and degradation; we do little
to speak of among the Celestial pagans on the Pacific slope; and our labor among the
Indians is light. But our Romish friends are now said to be spending $600,000 a year
among the freedmen, among whom they have 150,000 pupils under priestly schools.
There are 137 Catholic missionaries and teachers among the Indians.”&mdash;<i>President E. P.
Tenney, Colorado College.</i></p>

<p>&mdash;“The Roman Catholic Church has purchased a tract of 7,000 acres of land within
nine miles of Chase City, Va., and propose to colonize it, and educate the freedmen, on
the industrial farm plan.”&mdash;<cite>Evangelist.</cite></p>

<p>&mdash;A correspondent of the <cite>Christian Observer</cite> is informed that there are twenty-five
Romish schools in the three States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, with free
board and tuition.</p>

<p>&mdash;The following is the closing sentence of an affidavit, signed by Gen. Lopez Analto,
and sworn to before a U. S. Commissioner in Florida:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I further declare and say, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that there are negroes
from the United States at different places on the Island of Cuba, who are to this
day held as slaves, shipped from the United States, under various pretexts, since the rebellion
in the United States, and upon American vessels.”</p></div>

<p>The investigation of this matter was interrupted by the sudden death of Judge
Leonard.</p>

<p>&mdash;The delays, and partial defeat, of the various Central African Missions, are referred
to on an editorial page.</p>

<p>&mdash;One of the results to be anticipated from the establishment of new missionary stations
in the interior of Africa, is the effect which such civilized settlements among the
hunting-grounds of the slave-traders will have in suppressing that terrible evil. It is
still the whole business of thousands to buy or steal Circassian, Abyssinian, and negro
boys and, especially, girls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4>The Chinaman.</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the United States Circuit Court, at San Francisco, Judge Sawyer has rendered
a decision, in the case of the Chinaman who applied for naturalization papers, holding
that Chinamen are not white persons within the meaning of the term as used in the Naturalization
Laws, and are not entitled to become citizens. “White,” he holds to be equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to Caucasian; and that, by exact construction of the provision, all but white persons,
and persons of African nativity and descent, are excluded forever from citizenship.
The case will probably be appealed.</p>

<p>&mdash;We commend the story of Yung Wing, as told by Rev. Joseph Twichell, in his recent
lecture at New Haven, to those who are either hopeful or hopeless as to the Chinese
in America. Under his care, the Chinese Government is expending annually
$100,000 in maintaining about 120 Chinese boys at schools in Connecticut, where
they are receiving a thorough course of education.</p>

<p>&mdash;The Chinese in San Francisco paid, in 1866-67, more than $42,000 in school
taxes. California law omits Mongolian children from the apportionment of school funds,
refuses them admission to the common-schools, and opens no schools for them. Thirteen
hundred Chinamen have petitioned the Legislature for separate schools for their
three thousand children of proper age. Such are provided for those of African and
Indian descent. The petition was at once laid on the table. A leading paper stigmatized
it as a dangerous and aggressive indication of a movement on their part to
“obtain larger wages,” and showing a desire “to mingle their youth with ours, with a
view, doubtless, to more thorough assimilation in the body politic.” And yet, the burden
of the complaints against them has been that they will not assimilate, and will work
cheap! If consistency is a jewel, it is evidently not a “California diamond.”</p>

<p>&mdash;A correspondent of the <cite>Intelligencer</cite> asserts that the opposition to the Chinaman
is instigated mainly by the liquor-sellers and the Roman Catholic priests, neither
of whom has John any use for, and whose patrons he displaces.</p>

<p>&mdash;A Chinese church is to be organized at Oakland, Cal., composed in part of members
from Dr. Eells’ church, and the mission under the care of Rev. J. M. Condit.
This is the second church in California, all the members of which are Chinese.</p>

<p>&mdash;Prof. Mooar in <cite>Evangelist</cite>: “Our greatest danger in regard to this problem is
not that the Chinaman will be too pagan for us, but that we shall fail to be Christian
enough for him.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4>The Indian.</h4>

<p>&mdash;A writer in the <cite>Advance</cite> says that there are 6,500 persons in the Indian Territory,
formerly slaves of the Choctaws and Chickasaws. The treaty of 1866 provided
for their citizenship among the tribes, and an allotment of fifty acres of land to each.
In the first Indian Legislature after the treaty, a law was passed refusing to comply
with the treaty; so that, in the land where they were born, and where they toiled
in slavery to enrich their masters, they can own no land, cannot send their children to
the nation’s schools, are not permitted to vote, and have no protection from, nor access
to, the Indian courts of law. So, the big fish eat the little fish, all the way down.</p>

<p>&mdash;The various plans for organizing the Indian Territory under a territorial government,
are in the face of solemn treaties, and the opposition of the various tribes to
whom it has been promised. It is only another of the wrongs to which the poor
Indian has been subjected by the cupidity of his white neighbors, and their disregard of
the rights of so-called inferior races.</p>

<p>&mdash;The Bill creating the Territory of Oklahoma has been agreed upon by the House
Committee on Territories.</p>

<p>&mdash;As to the rebel Indians, Gen. Sheridan allows a Nez Percés prisoner to go to
the Canadian frontier, to offer immunity from punishment to the fugitives of that tribe,
if they surrender to the military. Some have left Sitting Bull, and refused to fight
with him longer. A band are raiding in Texas, in the neighborhood of Fort Ewell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
The Bannocks at Lemhi Agency, in Idaho, complain that the agent has defrauded them,
and threaten trouble. To Sitting Bull’s inquiries about peace, Gen. Miles answers
that, when the Indians give up their ponies and guns, they will receive cattle and other
property of greater value; and that when peace is made, the Government will provide
for them, as it does for all friendly Indians.</p>

<p>&mdash;The Nez Percés Indians take a Turkish bath every morning.&mdash;See Leavenworth
<cite>Times</cite>. The <cite>Christian Recorder</cite> (A. M. E.) says: “No people can go down who
make a plentiful use of soap and water.”</p>

<h2>THE FREEDMEN.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3><a name="STRAIGHT_UNIVERSITY" id="STRAIGHT_UNIVERSITY"></a>STRAIGHT UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<p class="center">New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>

<p class="secauth">REV. W. S. ALEXANDER, PRESIDENT.</p>

<p>The Institution was incorporated June
25th, 1869, and the first school building
was completed in February, 1870. The
American Missionary Association and the
Freedmen’s Bureau co-operated in the establishment
of the University. From the
first, great numbers flocked to the school
to enjoy its advantages, so that the capacity
of the building was taxed to its utmost.
The eagerness of the freedmen for education
in 1870, and the two or three years
following, was, perhaps, more intense and
general than now. Between three and
four thousand have been enrolled as students
in the University during the eight years of
its existence.</p>

<p>It bears the name of Hon. Seymour
Straight, of Ohio, who is one of its steadfast
friends and benefactors.</p>


<h4>LOCATION.</h4>

<p>New Orleans, a city of 220,000 inhabitants,
of whom 80,000 are colored people,
is a most important point to be occupied
in missionary work among the freedmen.
As the commercial centre of the
South-west&mdash;as the great cotton, sugar,
and rice market of the Union&mdash;it out-ranks
all others. In its intimate connections
by river, bayou, and railroad with
the most thickly populated negro districts
of the old slave States, it is second to none.
Texas, Mississippi, and Florida are constantly
adding to the negro population of
Louisiana. By the census of 1875 there
were 369,000 colored people in this State,
and each year swells the number. Already
it is fifty-five per cent. of the entire population.
Without disparagement to any other
section, we claim, also, that the colored population
of New Orleans represents the highest
intelligence yet attained by the race in
America. It includes the genuine African,
the mulatto, the quadroon, the octaroon,
and yet other shades and grades; and in this
mingling of races we see, also, the diffusion
of intelligence, and a corresponding increase
in the capacity of culture and development.
It would require the quick eye of an “expert”
to detect, in the fair complexion and
delicate features of many who throng our
churches and schools, the faintest trace of
African descent. Without speculating upon
the cause, certain it is that we find among
the colored people of the Crescent City a
quickness of intelligence, and a capacity for
the best culture and the noblest development,
and withal a thirst for knowledge,
which is worthy of our best sympathy and
most generous benevolence.</p>


<h4>THE RESULTS WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH.</h4>

<p>In a word, our aim is Education, in
its broadest and best meaning. The elevation,
the prosperity, the highest manhood,
and the co-ordinate rank of the African
race in America, in the friendly rivalry of
races, are still in the future&mdash;whether in
the near or remote future, depends largely
upon the race itself to determine. Education,
under Divine guidance, is the gateway
to that longed-for future. That I
mean education as allied with religion, will
be assumed. That the race is not educated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
is by no fault of theirs. That they desire
education, is to their credit. To help them
to this education is both our duty and our
privilege.</p>

<p>The courses of study in this Institution
include in the Academic Department, the
Collegiate, the Normal, and the Preparatory;
and in the Professional Department,
the Theological and the Law.</p>

<p>We have a preparatory course, that we
may secure better material for the higher
courses. In the Normal course, special attention
is given to those studies which will
furnish young men and women with the
education needed in the various branches
of business life open to them, and which
especially will qualify them as teachers, for
which there is, and must continue to be, a
great demand. In the Collegiate Department&mdash;which
includes, among other studies,
the higher Mathematics, Mental and Moral
Philosophy, and Latin&mdash;a higher grade and
wider scope of studies will be added so soon
as there is a demand for them. The school
is yet in its infancy, and the number of
those who are fitted to pursue to advantage
the highest grade of studies is, of course,
very limited.</p>


<h4>LAW DEPARTMENT.</h4>

<p>An able corps of Professors has been secured.
Jurists of reputation and successful
practice at the bar of Louisiana have
kindly offered their services, with little hope
of adequate compensation, and every facility
is provided for young men of talent, who
are attracted by the profession of the law,
to fit themselves for honorable and successful
practice. Regular graduates from this
department, at the conclusion of a two
years’ course of study, and a well sustained
examination, are admitted to the bar of
New Orleans, with authority to practice in
all the courts of the Commonwealth.</p>


<h4>THEOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT.</h4>

<p>College graduates, who can be instructed
in the original languages in which the
Scriptures were written, are greatly desired,
and until they can be secured, this
department will but partially accomplish
the object for which it was organized. The
churches need thoroughly educated ministers,
with carefully cultivated minds, who
can intelligently preach the word. The
degree of suffering for the lack of such ministers
cannot be told. In the meantime, it
is our aim to make the best use of the material
we have, and transform it from a
state of utter crudeness to one of partial
fitness for the present demands of the
churches. Men of piety and ability to
speak and to teach are received, and advanced
as far and as rapidly as their imperfect
preparatory education will admit.
Louisiana, with a colored population of
370,000, is ripe for a glorious spiritual harvest.
The churches are calling in vain for
intelligent laborers to go forth into the harvest.
I wish the prospect was brighter for
a large class of intelligent, spiritual, and
enthusiastic students to enter this department,
and to lift it to a high grade of usefulness.</p>


<h4>THE NEW UNIVERSITY.</h4>

<p>The building on Esplanade street, built
in 1870, was entirely destroyed by fire February
16th, 1877. Since that disastrous
event, our sessions have been held in Central
Church, which is also the property of
the American Missionary Association. A
new site, more convenient and attractive,
was purchased in January last. It is located
on Canal street, the most beautiful
avenue in New Orleans. It comprises a
half square of land, 150 feet front by 310
feet in depth. The new building, for whose
design great credit is due to Prof. Thomas
N. Chase, while not adhering strictly to any
style of architecture, may be classed as <em>Italian</em>,
as it approaches more nearly to that
order. The dimensions of the building are
72 feet by 51½ feet. The five large recitation
rooms are 30 feet by 50½ feet. The
halls are 10 feet in width. The building is
conveniently arranged, and all the requirements
of the school, we think, have been
anticipated in its design. The funds at the
disposal of the Association did not admit of
ornamentation; but the building, when completed,
will be substantial, convenient, and
comely. It will be ready for dedication
and occupation at the opening of the fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
term, October 1st. Grateful as we are for
this new structure, we are not satisfied;
neither should the friends of the freedmen
in the North be satisfied. Straight University,
in order to fill the measure of its
usefulness, and cultivate the territory open
to its occupation, must furnish accommodations
for students from abroad&mdash;from towns
outside of New Orleans, and from adjoining
States. It must have <em>dormitories</em>. Two
buildings, one on either side of the main
building, are urgently needed, and at the
earliest possible day. Then, when our
group of buildings are completed, we can invite
and welcome the best talent of the
race, at whatever distance from New Orleans
it may be found. Then our beloved
University will become, among the educational
institutions of the South-west&mdash;and
especially of the Gulf States&mdash;the magnet,
attracting to itself the best in intellect, in
heart, and in promise of future good.</p>

<h3>VIRGINIA.</h3>
<h4>Additions to the Church&mdash;An Indian’s Creed&mdash;A
Good Beginning.</h4>

<p class="secauth">REV. RICHARD TOLMAN, HAMPTON.</p>

<p>Four students united with the church by
profession the first Sabbath in May. It is
several years since any Communion season
has passed without some additions to the
church.</p>

<p>The fifteen Indians who have lately joined
the school have taken hold of study and of
manual labor with commendable zeal, and
give promise of becoming good teachers
and guides of their race. One of them
now shows evidence of Christian character.
Their promptness and decision, as to the
duties required of them, were put to the
test in reference to the use of tobacco, to
which they were so strongly attached that,
as one of them said:&mdash;“There are three
things I love: I love God; I love Jesus; I
love smoke.” When asked if they would
comply with the rules of the school, prohibiting
the use of tobacco, after considering
the matter awhile in silence, one of them
gave an expressive sign that he would cut
loose from tobacco; and then all the others
gave the same significant pledge&mdash;a pledge
which, their teacher assures us, they will
never break.</p>

<h3>SOUTH CAROLINA.</h3>
<h4>History of “Avery” Graduates.</h4>

<p class="secauth">PROF. A. W. FARNHAM, CHARLESTON, S. C.</p>

<p>Avery Normal Institute was organized in
Charleston, S. C., October, 1865. The first
formal graduation occurred in June, 1872,
at which time eleven young people received
diplomas from the Institute. A class has
been graduated each succeeding year, numbering
as follows: In 1873, fourteen; 1874,
six; 1875, fifteen; 1876, nineteen (including
one post-graduate); 1877, twenty-two&mdash;giving
a total of eighty-six. Of this number,
death has taken five.</p>

<p>Our school aims to fit its graduates to be
competent teachers. Forty-six have been
engaged in the public schools of the State&mdash;schools
first in rank, in scholarship, and discipline.
Forty-one of the forty-six are
teaching to-day; seventeen hold State certificates.</p>

<p>One young man of the class of 1872 is an
ordained minister. He was also graduated
at South Carolina University in 1877.
Another from that class, and one from the
succeeding class, are studying with the
ministry in view&mdash;one at Madison University,
New York, the other at Atlanta University,
Georgia. Three others from later
classes are in higher institutions, preparing
themselves to preach the Gospel.</p>

<p>Our graduates bid fair to represent all
the professions. One is in Howard University,
studying medicine, and one in the
leading Normal school of our county, preparing
for teaching. The total number in
higher institutions is seven, while four more
have already received the degree of A. B.
Five others were in South Carolina University
when it closed its doors. These
young men were ready to enter the Junior
year of the College course when their studies
were so abruptly ended. With one exception,
they are teaching.</p>

<p>Thirty-eight of our graduates are members
of Evangelical churches; twenty at
present are engaged in Sunday-school work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“By their fruits ye shall know them.”
But is this all that Avery has done? No!
Her influence has pervaded the homes of
hundreds, and the lives of thousands. Her
light has shone in every quarter of the
State; and other lands are destined to share
in her gifts, for the good ship Azor is carrying
three of her pupils to <a name="Err_3" id="Err_3"></a>“Africa’s sunny
fountains.”</p>

<p>The questions are often asked: “What
per cent. of your school is brown?” “Don’t
the browns receive instruction more readily
than the blacks?” The query, in the minds
of so many, has led to an actual count of
the graduates with regard to color, which
gives: <em>Black</em>, 19; <em>brown</em>, 55; <em>fair</em>, 12.
But, “the Lord is the maker of them all;”
nor is He “a respecter of persons.” We
sow “beside all waters.” “What shall
the harvest be?”</p>

<h3>GEORGIA.</h3>
<h4>Pilgrim Church and Sunday-School&mdash;Band
of Hope&mdash;Twichell School.</h4>

<p class="secauth">REV. JOHN H. H. SENGSTACKE, WOODVILLE.</p>

<p>This small settlement of colored people
is situated three miles west of Savannah,
Ga. It was bought by a Northern agent,
and divided into half-acre lots, which are
now selling, on the instalment plan, for seventy-five
dollars each. The houses are
very small and uncomfortable; but since
the American Missionary Association has
erected a new meeting-house and parsonage,
the people have commenced to put up
better dwellings, and a strong love for
home comforts is gradually taking hold
upon the masses. The inhabitants of
Woodville obtain a living by selling in the
city market, or laboring in gardens and on
rice plantations. In this settlement there
are two groceries, and three on its border,
where strong drink is sold, even on the
Lord’s day.</p>

<p>The only house of worship in this place
is the Pilgrim Congregational Church.
This church was organized in 1871 as the
Woodville Church, and re-organized in 1875
as the Pilgrim Church. A new site was
chosen, and the present meeting-house was
erected in the same year. This church has
been a great blessing to the people. A
deep religious feeling has prevailed in our
midst, and many have become savingly acquainted
with the Lord Jesus Christ. Rev.
Mr. Markham is deeply interested in this
little church, and a great assistant to the
young pastor in charge. A revival is still
in progress; twenty persons have been
recently added to the church, and seven
are waiting to be received at the next
Communion.</p>

<p>The Sabbath-school is prospering. We
have no well qualified teachers as yet, but
Twichell School is preparing instructors for
this work. We need lesson papers and
other papers. Who will help us in this direction?
Our Band of Hope consists of both
adults and children. This society is working
hard to save men from a drunkard’s
grave, and hell. It has much opposition to
overcome. The rum-sellers and whisky-drinking
church-people are its worst enemies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twichell School.</span>&mdash;This school is held
in the church, and is taught by the pastor.
Through the benevolence of the A. M. A.
and the Congregational Church Sabbath-school
at Grand Rapids, Mich., we have
been able to instruct hundreds of children,
and it is pleasing to know that our labor
has not been in vain, for many of the little
ones are rejoicing in Christ the Lord.
Mrs. S. N. M., of Dubuque, Iowa, “the
Merry Workers,” at Grand Rapids, Mich.,
and other Northern friends, deserve our sincere
thanks for the deep interest they have
taken in this work. Every effort put forth
in the name of Jesus to elevate this ignorant
people deserves the heartiest encouragement.</p>

<h4>School Children Farming&mdash;Their Parents
Buying Farms.</h4>

<p class="secauth">SEABORN SNELSON, MCINTOSH.</p>

<p>Our school is very small, as it always is
at this season of the year, the children
having to assist their parents in farming.
For that reason, during the summer months
of the previous years, we have had to teach
about two hours at night, for the benefit of
those who could not come in the daytime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
We have not yet commenced night-school
this year, though it is desired by many.</p>

<p>There are many children in our neighborhood
who belong to our school, but we
find it very difficult to get all, or the most
of them, to attend school regularly. We
have a pretty good average attendance,
but do not at all times have the same
scholars, which causes much discord and
delay.</p>

<p>The children seem to be anxious to
learn, but it is done in the midst of hardships
which are uncommon to children in
many other places. The older people are
not as much interested in the education of
their children as they should be, by a great
deal.</p>

<p>Only two schools for the colored children
are kept up during the year in this
county, namely, Second Midway and Old
Midway. There are other places I know
of in this county, where much might be
done in the way of instructing the people
in the right way, and they would be very
glad to receive it; but the aid is wanting.</p>

<p>About two-thirds of the colored people
in this county are trying to buy land, and
really some have succeeded in so doing;
but it is done by about four years’ <em>hard</em>
labor and strict economy. There is very
little money in this county, and it will be
so until the colored people pay for and take
possession of these lands. After a couple
of years they will be able to do much for
themselves in many ways.</p>

<h4>A Growing School&mdash;A Literary Society.</h4>

<p class="secauth">COSMO P. JORDAN, MARIETTA.</p>

<p>The Mission School at Marietta was
opened Oct. 15th, 1877, with four pupils
only. The 2d day of January, 1878, there
were fourteen. The end of January found
a roll of thirty-seven, which has steadily increased
to seventy-two. It may be seen that
the growth of this school was not very rapid,
from the fact that it was opposed by many
of the colored people in the city. But the
more water they threw on this little spark,
the brighter and faster it burned, till it has
become a centre of attraction. Friends of
this work are fast multiplying, and the future
seems bright.</p>

<p>My school is composed of some very
bright and promising young men and women,
seven of whom go out every summer
to teach. The studies are spelling, reading,
writing, geography, composition, grammar,
and arithmetic.</p>

<p>To this work is attached a literary society,
known as the Junto, the exercises of
which consist of reading, speaking, discussions,
and singing. It was likewise opposed,
but is now as largely attended as
any church in the city.</p>

<p>Our school, in age, ranks among the older
ones, having been established in the Spring
of 1866, and we have been its teachers continuously
up to the present time. First,
we were missionary teachers; after a time
the Freedmen’s Bureau lent us its aid, until
the organization of free schools by the
State; thereafter, we taught the public
school until last year.</p>

<p>During all these years of varying fortunes
our school has steadily progressed,
until there has grown up around us a generation
of young people, not great, nor wise,
nor learned, only as they are compared with
those who have gone before them; but,
standing out from the blackness of darkness
of twelve years ago, they furnish a
bright and hopeful outlook.</p>

<p>We organized a Temperance society
early in our work here, and it has never
died out. We, several years ago, gave the
control into the hands of the young people,
being only members, for service, when
needed. They have changed names, and
banners, and badges more than once&mdash;just
now it is blue ribbon&mdash;but the object has
always been the same. Our Sunday-school
has always claimed our best efforts, and we
are glad to know that more than two-thirds
of our older scholars are professing Christians.
But the work done is but a drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
compared with that which is not done. We
have lived to see very many hopes and
dreams fade out, and to learn that manhood
and womanhood are not plants of the gourd
family&mdash;Jonah’s kind, at least. The knowledge
of what we have not done, and cannot
do, is sometimes very hard to bear; and,
perhaps, we have thus learned to do what
we can the more gladly, feeling sure that
we, ourselves, grow thereby. And maybe
this is a part of the work, for we, too, are
our Father’s children.</p>

<h3>THEOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT OF HOWARD
UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<h4>Its Catholicity&mdash;Closing Exercises.</h4>

<p>The year of the Theological Department
of Howard University has just closed. This
department is under the joint care and support
of the Presbytery of Washington, and
of the American Missionary Association.
The former sustains Rev. L. Westcott, as
Professor of Revealed Theology and Biblical
History, and Rev. A. W. Pitzer, D. D.,
as Professor of Biblical Studies and Moral
Science; the latter supplies the instruction
given by the President, Rev. Wm. W. Patton,
D. D., in Natural Theology, the Evidences
of Revealed Religion, and Hebrew,
and by Rev. John G. Butler, D. D., in
Pastoral Theology, Church History, and
Homiletics. The theological students this
year have numbered thirty-two. These are
in all stages of preparation for their expected
work. Several are already ministers,
and are preaching, every Sunday, as
pastors of colored churches in Washington;
but, having had no early advantages, they
are making up deficiencies as best they can.</p>

<p>The theological students come from seven
different denominations, while their instructors
represent four. This is an unusual illustration
of Christian union, and shows
how much can be done, on a simple evangelical
basis, for meeting the pressing wants
of the colored population of our land. The
work needs to be conducted on a broad,
generous basis. We can thus introduce a
powerful leaven of truth and righteousness
where it is especially needed. The plan of
instruction has been, to meet the special
wants of each individual according to his
age, his forwardness or backwardness of
study, the time that he could remain, etc.
Such as have enjoyed a classical education,
are encouraged to take the regular three
years’ course pursued in all theological
seminaries. Others are taught what is
found to be most needed to fit them for
their work, in the form of English studies.
Six have studied the Hebrew this year,
and they passed a creditable examination
in the grammar, and in translation, averaging
quite as well as ordinary white students
in theological institutions. These students
also attend the Bible-class conducted by
the president on the morning of the Lord’s
day, and his preaching service in the afternoon,
in the latter of which he has lately,
in a series of discourses, pointed out the
weakness and absurdity of modern skepticism,
as an antidote to the influence of the
infidel lecturer, popularly called “Bob”
Ingersoll, who has taken up his abode in
Washington.</p>

<p>Although the theological students have
numbered thirty-two this year, it so happens
that but one has completed his course;
and as a distinguished clergyman who, it
was hoped, would deliver the address at
the anniversary, failed us at too late a
moment to substitute any one else, the
closing exercises took the form of a debate
by eight of the young men, on this question:
“Has a church a right to make total
abstinence from intoxicating drinks a condition
of membership?” This point was
debated with much earnestness and shrewdness,
and arguments, <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em>, were
drawn ingeniously from reason and Scripture
in a way which testified favorably to the
abilities of the speakers. One of the Judges
of the Supreme Court of the United States
takes a deep interest in this department of
the University, and lately expressed himself
emphatically in favor of encouraging and
endowing it, as an important means of elevating
the colored ministry and churches of
all denominations. Its friends anticipate
for it a future bright with usefulness.</p>

<h3>THE INTERNATIONAL SUNDAY-SCHOOL
CONVENTION.</h3>

<p class="secauth">MRS. T. N. CHASE, ATLANTA.</p>

<p>As gems are valued by their rarity, so
you can imagine how such a gathering as
the Sunday-school Convention seemed to
us in Georgia.</p>

<p>We were favored, not more by hearing
the appointed speakers in the great Convention,
than by the personal presence and
good words of many of its delegates in our
own school-room. Gen. Fisk, who has
given not only his name, but his heart and
hand to our Fisk University, took Atlanta
and the Convention by storm with his
happy address of welcome. It seems
to me our young men can never lose
the inspiration of hope and courage that
must have come to them from him, whose
youthful struggles had even exceeded many
of their own. Then we heard Dr. H. M.
Parsons. All who ever listened to him will
understand how, at the close of his words,
we felt that, next to the Rock Christ
Jesus, there was not beneath the sun so
firm a foundation as our blessed Bible.
Another day, Dr. McVicar, a college president
from Montreal, warned us of the
Jesuits, with an earnestness such as, perhaps,
only a good Scotch Presbyterian could
feel. Then we had “Hope Ledyard,” the
charming correspondent, whose young life
seems too exquisitely moulded to have always
escaped the loving Father’s crucible.</p>

<p>Best of all, we had good words from
many not heard in the Convention, and,
perhaps, unknown to fame. There was
Judge Harman, of Oswego. How his clear
eye took in the large possibilities of our
work, and how his great heart went out
toward us! As he warned us of the perils
of a life without Jesus, and the depths of
despair into which life’s trials could plunge
a soul unsupported by the Everlasting
Arms, his peaceful face and silvery hair
assuring us he knew whereof he affirmed,
some of us had rare glimpses into the
blessed beyond. The words of Rev. A.
P. Foster, Dr. Tully, and several that
I was prevented from hearing, so lifted
both teachers and pupils above the plane of
plodding school life, that we almost trembled
to look down. The fact that many such men,
of kindred mind and heart, filled the silent
pews of the Convention, seemed to me the
secret of its power. We had heard as
good papers from other platforms, but
the sight of such a body, all delighting in
the Master’s command, “Feed My lambs,”
was enough to send us to our homes
feeling, as one of our girls expressed it, “I
know I shall be a better woman for having
attended the Convention.”</p>

<p>In response to an invitation for the delegates
to visit our school, Governor Colquitt,
who presided, remarked to the Convention:
“The University is a good place to
visit, and is doing a good work”; and added
that he had a servant who had attended our
school some years, and the instruction received
there had not pushed him above
his position&mdash;he was the same humble,
faithful boy about his work. Every summer
he came to him for a recommendation
to teach, which he cheerfully gave him,
and the boy always returned in the fall the
same good, modest young man.</p>

<p>Dr. McVicar also took a public occasion
to express his appreciation of our work.
After the close of his sermon, at the Central
Presbyterian Church here, while recounting
to the audience the many things
of interest he had enjoyed in their city, he
remarked that he had recently visited most
of the universities of Europe, and added
that nothing in Atlanta, or the great universities
abroad, had interested him so
heartily as their Atlanta University.</p>

<h3>ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SOUTH-WESTERN
CONFERENCE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. W. S. ALEXANDER.</p>

<p>New Iberia was the place selected for
our Annual Meeting this year, April 3-5,
and one more attractive, or more important
to the general interests of our work, could
not have been chosen. This church was organized
in 1866, and has a membership of
117, of which thirty have been received on
profession of faith the past year. The population
of the city is about 3,000, of whom
nearly, if not quite, fifty per cent. are colored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The South-western Conference is composed
of fourteen Congregational churches,
of which twelve were represented at our
Annual Meeting.</p>

<p>The reports from the churches showed
very clearly that the past year had been
one of marked activity and spiritual prosperity.
Several churches, as the Central,
in New Orleans, and St. Mark’s, in Terrebonne,
have been blessed with revivals of
great power. Other churches have been
cutting off dead branches, and putting
themselves in condition for better service.
In tabulating the reports, I find that the present
membership of the churches of our Conference
is 806. There have been added on
profession during the year (ending April
1st, 1878,) <em>one hundred and thirteen</em>, and
four by letter. Forty-seven adults and
<em>eighty babies</em> have been baptized.</p>

<p>As I have already spoken of the precious
revival in Central Church, in which more
than fifty were converted, and the church
itself greatly quickened and refreshed,
I will not recite the facts again. The
church of Brother Clay (one of the
veterans and pioneers of Congregationalism
in Louisiana), in Terrebonne,
has passed through joyful and glorious experiences.
The church has been thronged
for days and weeks. Mr. Clay said: “I
did not know where all the people came
from. The church and church-yard were
filled with a dense mass of people. It
seemed as though they sprung out of the
ground.” Night after night the earnest
truths of the Gospel were preached, and
night after night “mourners” crowded the
anxious seats, crying for mercy. The
people came from long distances, five and
seven miles. God put honor upon His
word, and many have been converted, and
still the good work goes on. Pastor Clay’s
heart is filled with joy and thankfulness.</p>


<h4>QUESTIONS DISCUSSED.</h4>

<p>Among the topics considered at the
Conference were the following:</p>

<p><em>Revivals</em>: The best method of promoting
and conducting them. <em>Education</em>: The
demand of the hour; how shall we meet
it? <em>Faith</em>: Its nature; how can we secure
greater faith? Its joys and its triumphs.
What more can we do to reach
the people with the Gospel?</p>

<p>These questions were discussed with vigor
and interest. Of course, no speeches had
been prepared in advance, and I was surprised
at the real excellence of the addresses.
Mistakes in grammar were sometimes
made, and there were not many classical
allusions, but the speeches had the
true ring, and good will come of them.</p>


<h4>PUBLIC SERVICES.</h4>

<p>The opening sermon was given by the
Moderator, Mr. Alexander, from Matthew
1, 23: “They shall call his name Emmanuel;
which being interpreted is, God
with us.” It was a great pleasure to speak
to such an audience. The church was
densely packed, the entry was filled; people
took positions under the windows on the
outside, and fully one hundred, having sought
admission in vain, went reluctantly away.
Mr. Hall, of New Orleans, preached the
second evening; after which, the Moderator
made an address on “Christian Unity,”
in the hope of removing or modifying some
of the asperities and jealousies existing
among the colored churches. The address
was received with strong expressions of
sympathy. One good old “auntie” said
the next day: “Don’t you say anything
against that minister. He is trying to
build up both sides. He don’t wish to
break down anybody.”</p>


<h4>ORDINATION.</h4>

<p>On Friday evening Mr. Homer Jones, a
member of the church at New Iberia, but
a resident at Lake Piegneur, having passed
a faithful examination before the Conference
regarding his Christian experience, his
religious belief, and his ability to preach,
was ordained as an Evangelist.</p>

<p>Bro. Jones is a warm-hearted Christian,
and will make an able and successful minister.
He has served the churches faithfully for
two years or more without compensation.
He owns a small farm of eighteen acres on
the shore of the beautiful Lake Piegneur.
His worthy wife was for a short time a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
student in Straight University. He expresses
his willingness to leave his beautiful
home, and go anywhere, even to Africa,
where God may call him.</p>


<h4>FAREWELL MEETING.</h4>

<p>Friday morning was devoted to a “farewell
prayer-meeting.” It was a most tender
and impressive scene. As one after another
spoke, “the fire burned”; every eye was
wet with manly tears, and when the entire
Conference rose and joined hands, and they
sang or chanted an old refrain, peculiar to
themselves, beginning “Good-by, and shake
hands,” and we entered into covenant with
God and with each other to go forth to
another year of labor and self-denial, those
dear brethren, in the excess of religious
emotion, laughed and cried together. Thus
was our meeting of 1878 brought to a
close. The good pastor at New Iberia
said: “Such a light was never kindled here
before.” The Conference adjourned to meet
in New Iberia next year, at the call of the
Moderator.</p>

<p>Dear brethren of the North, pray for us,
and remember that we are trying to hold
this distant outpost of the Church, and to
extend, in this beautiful and fruitful land,
the cherished faith and polity of our
fathers.</p>

<h3>THE SINGERS TO THE MISSIONARIES,
GREETING.</h3>


<p class="medium">We give the following extracts from a letter, written
by the Jubilee Singers, from Erfurt, Germany, to
the new missionaries to Africa. From the fact
that they are all Fisk University students, the
greetings of the gleaners in Europe to the sowers
in Africa is full of pathetic interest:</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Erfurt, Germany.</span><br />
</p>

<p>To <span class="smcap">Albert P. Miller</span>, <span class="smcap">Ada Roberts
Miller</span>, <span class="smcap">Andrew E. Jackson</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Ella Hildridge Jackson</span>, Missionaries
for Africa:</p>

<p><em>Dear Brothers and Sisters</em>: The Jubilee
Singers send greeting. Could we give
you our greeting in person, it would be
more satisfactory, as we can but feebly convey
to you, in writing, how our hearts have
gone out to you in love and sympathy, and
up to God in thankfulness, since the glad
tidings reached us of your having consecrated
your lives and talents to mission
work among our brethren in Africa. We
have prayed and labored long for this day,
and now, thank God, our prayers are being
answered.</p>

<p>We realize in how large a degree our
success has been attributable to the faithful
prayers of you and your fellow-students,
sent up daily in our behalf from Fisk University;
and let us assure you that while
you are doing battle for the Master, by
helping to lift the dark pall of barbarism
and superstition which enshrouds our kinsmen,
you, in like manner, will be sustained
by the prayers of your fellow students, and
warm, earnest Christian hearts, not only in
our own native land, but in Great Britain,
Holland and Germany. They will follow
your footsteps, faithfully and prayerfully,
watching for the fruits which ye shall reap,
in due season, if ye faint not, and rejoicing
with you in the extension of Christ’s kingdom.</p>

<p>You are our first band of missionaries at
the outpost of the American Missionary
Association in the land of our forefathers.
May the light of God so shine in your hearts
that its reflected rays shall be a balm to
those who may come to you, to be healed
and taught of God. May He give you
strength to thrust in the “sharpened sickle”
when the fields are ripe for the harvest,
and the laborers so few.</p>

<p>With the love and best wishes of the
Jubilee Singers.</p>

<h3>Arrival of the New Missionaries.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. FLOYD SNELSON.</p>

<p>I received the letters, telling of the new
missionaries on the way to our mission, with
great joy. I left home late last Thursday
afternoon for this place to meet them. We
came on very well until Friday night about
ten o’clock, at which time we were caught
in quite a storm, and had to anchor. As
I had not been here since our first arrival,
there were many things to look after.</p>

<p>Just as I was finishing up last night, the
steamer came in, bringing them. I got out
to them about 8.30 P.M., and spent nearly
an hour with them. I am very favorably
impressed with the first view of my new co-workers,
and hope now to be able to carry
on the work to greater success and with
more ease.</p>

<p>Next morning they came ashore, and
expressed themselves as favorably surprised
at the appearance of the place and people.
On the 26th, we hope to leave early for
Good Hope.</p>

<h3>First Impressions of Africa&mdash;A Sunday
Service&mdash;A School Celebration.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. ALBERT MILLER.</p>

<p>On reaching Freetown, and walking
about the place and conversing with the
natives, we were very favorably disappointed.
Some are very intelligent and kind-hearted.
We attended a Sunday-School in the afternoon,
and were much pleased to hear the
children read and sing. They reminded
me of a small country school in the South.
A little boy played on the organ. We
visited several of the natives, and I was
everywhere surprised at seeing so much
intelligence displayed. Brother Snelson
had made all necessary preparations for
our coming. The mission house had been
fitted up nicely, so that we soon felt as if
we were in an American village. We remained
in Freetown two days, and Brother
Snelson lost no time in showing us the
many things of interest in this African city.
We visited the market, and saw many
things in the line of fruits to interest us.
All were well pleased, but still longed to
reach our adopted home.</p>

<p>Leaving Freetown on the 25th of March,
we arrived here on the 28th, early in the
morning. The men rowed all night. Mrs.
Snelson, Mr. White and the children of the
mission met us at the wharf. We could
not have been more kindly received by any
persons. We have been here several days
now, and find the work promising and
encouraging. Brother Snelson and his
helpers are hard at work, and things, I
suppose, are much more hopeful than they
have been for years.</p>

<p>The church was filled last Sabbath to
its utmost capacity with hearers. Brother
S., I think is the right man in the right
place. The only charge I am able to bring
against him is overwork. He has the confidence
of the people, which is so necessary
to success. Services were conducted by
Brother Jackson and myself.</p>

<p>I find the people kind and obliging.
They are very happy to have us, of their
own race, come and teach and labor
among them. Some seem ready to shout.
We are well pleased with our new home,
and are in a good state of health. The
heat is very intense. All things seem to
indicate a better day for the sable sons of
Ham. Africa is not what rumor represents
it to be&mdash;at least, what I have seen of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 3, 1878.</span>&mdash;To-day has been one
of great interest, both to parents and children.
The day-school, under the general
management of Brother White, turned out.
An examination took place in the forenoon,
after which the schools (day and Sabbath),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
with two banners waving o’er head, came
marching to a place near the mission-house,
where a dinner had been prepared for them.
Brother Snelson led the schools, and the
children, full of joy, followed him. He led
them through the principal streets of this
our city, the sides of the streets being filled
with lookers-on. All this seemed new to
them, and I dare say it is new to this part
of Africa. We had music, but very different
from such as our American friends are
accustomed to. An old tin box served as
kettle-drum. This, with other instruments,
made music sufficient for the children to
march and keep pretty good time. Returning
to the tables, the little ones ate dinner,
using spoons, which is something very new
to them. Each one seemed to be happy.
The patrons were called upon to contribute
for the giving of this dinner. Many responded,
sending chickens, rice, etc. Of
course, the whole affair was devolved upon
Brother Snelson. He received contributions
from traders and officials, many of
whom are here on the coast. These, you
will remember, are white, the friendship
and kind favor of whom Brother S. has
gained. They did not attend the exercises
of the day, but came out at night, and listened
to speeches from members of the
school. The pupils spoke and sang well,
and reminded me very much of my past experience
in the South&mdash;so Southern-like.</p>

<p>All were highly pleased with the exercises
of the evening. The American flag
was on one side of the house, that of England
on the other&mdash;thus bringing all in
attendance between them. These two flags
during the day were unfurled to the gentle
breeze with which we were favored. Many
of the leading men of Bonthe were here,
and, with those from other places, took tea
with us. I gain more interest daily for
this my field of labor. I shall not wait to
become acclimated, but shall proceed to
labor at once.</p>

<h3>Advantages of Colored Missionaries.</h3>

<p class="secauth">EXTRACT OF LETTER FROM A. E. WHITE.</p>

<p>You would like to know what I think
about colored missionaries doing good here.
My firm belief is, that they can do more than
any other missionaries under the sun. These
people have always been used to colored
people. Most of the white men whom
they have seen were traders, seeking their
own good. They robbed the people of their
produce and children, and destroyed their
confidence. A white missionary has to be
more careful than a colored one. The
natives look upon a white person as unnatural,
and think he is above them in every
way, and that God made him so. They
also think it is of no use for them to try to
do the things they see the white man do.
But, on the other hand, when they see a
colored man do anything, they think if he
can do it they can do it themselves. They
are a great people to imitate. For a proof
of what I have said, look at the Shengay
Mission. It is conducted altogether by
colored missionaries, and stands ahead of
others on the coast. Do not think I say
this because I am a colored man. I say it
because I know it is true.</p>

<h3>School Wants and Farm Work.</h3>

<p class="secauth">W. W. WHEELER, KESHENA, WIS.</p>

<p>The school opened very encouragingly
this term, and before the close of the second
week we had fifty-four different boarding
scholars, and were compelled to refuse admission
to others, on account of our limited
accommodations. Soon the scarlet-fever
broke out, and before the close of the term
twenty-three boarding scholars, and many
of our day scholars, had been sent home on
account of sickness.</p>

<p>The boarding scholars seem, generally, to
be happy and contented with us, and eager
to return at the opening of each new term;
and their progress in their studies, and general
deportment, is much greater than with
the day scholars. The general interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
also, of the tribe in the subject of education
is greatly quickened. The boarding-school,
with suitable accommodations, might be
made a great blessing to the tribe. We
feel sure we could readily obtain 100 scholars
if we had the accommodations.</p>

<p>The tribe has asked the Department to
appropriate, from their funds in the United
States Treasury, $6,000 for the erection of
a suitable building.</p>

<p>We see the dreadful results, in other
tribes around us, of allowing the youth to
grow up, without education, in contact with
the whites, learning their vices and not their
virtues, and it makes us long to see something
done to save this people from the
blight which has fallen upon so many other
tribes before them.</p>

<p>I have spent nearly three weeks going
over the Reservation since school closed,
visiting from farm to farm, encouraging the
Indians to make larger improvements; and I
have been very greatly gratified to notice so
many already clearing up new lands. I
have only found three or four families who
will not clear up some new ground this
spring. Some will clear as much as three
or four acres. Many are chopping and
logging heavy timber without any team to
help them.</p>

<p>I think there will be 300 acres of new land
cleared this spring. I expect to distribute
(only to those who clear at least one acre)
1,000 bushels of potatoes, besides corn, oats,
wheat, and vegetable seeds, for many of
them have not yet learned to provide beforehand.
There are, however, quite a
number who not only have enough for their
own seed, but some to sell.</p>

<p>Could the boarding-school be kept up
regularly for a few years, we should have
great hopes for the future of this tribe, but
there seems to be a strange lack of interest
in this matter on the part of the authorities
at Washington. We are now anxiously
waiting for instructions to re-open this
school. Meanwhile, the day-school is in
operation, with an attendance of twenty-two
scholars.</p>

<h3>Fung Affoo’s Bible Class&mdash;Visalia and
Petaluma.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. W. C. POND, SAN FRANCISCO.</p>

<p>Remembering that the Sabbath worship
at our Central Mission had never been
described, though often alluded to in the
<span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, I requested Bro. Fung Affoo
to give an account of it, and received the
following communication:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“As we have not much time to teach
them the Scripture on any other evening,
we set apart Sunday and Wednesday evenings
to teach them to read the Bible instead
of their other lessons. On Sunday
we have the “Bible-class,” commencing at
half-past eleven A. M., and continuing for
one hour and a half. We sing about half an
hour either in Chinese or in English, then
offer a prayer, and then read a chapter from
the Bible. Each verse they read after me,
then I translate it into Chinese; when
through interpreting, on each verse or
paragraph I make some remarks which
I have studied out during the week days.
After we get through the chapter, I speak
about ten minutes on a subject selected
from that chapter beforehand, then one of
our brethren offers prayer; we then unite
in singing the Doxology, and close with the
Lord’s Prayer. Our exercises on Wednesday
evening are similar to those we have
on Sundays. It gives me much encouragement
in the work seeing that they like to
read the Bible more than ever before.
Formerly only about one-half of the school
attended the Bible-class on Wednesday
evenings, but now they number nearly as
many on that evening as on any other evening
of the week. It seems as though their
hatred of Christianity becomes less. Of
course, many come to read the Bible only
for the sake of learning the English, but in
time we hope, when they know the truth of
God, they will change their mind and heart,
as some of them have already done, who
are now on Christ’s side, battling for the
Lord.”</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Fung Affoo.</span>”<br />
</p></div>

<p>The attendance at this Sabbath noon
service averages about fifty-five. Of course,
my pastoral duties render it impossible for
me ever to be present. I do not think, however,
that my presence would add anything
to the worship or the work. I assist the
helpers in their preparation, but I believe
that in dealing with their countrymen they
are more skilful than I could be, even if I
could speak Chinese. It needs an experience
in heathenism, to enable one to
reach the heathen in the most efficient way.
God chooses saved <em>sinners</em> to be messengers
of salvation to those still lost. I think
that the programme of this service, as Bro.
Fung Affoo gives it, illustrates this fact.
It is not one of my planning&mdash;not the one
I should have chosen; but as I carefully
consider it, I ask, “What <em>could be</em> better
fitted for those for whom the service is
arranged?”</p>

<p>Rev. T. M. Oviatt, whose missionary
labors among the Chinese at San Leandro
were attended with so rich a blessing, is
now acting pastor of the Presbyterian
church at Visalia. He has carried there
his zeal for this good work; has already
rented a small room, and opened a school.
We shall aid him as far as we are able.
Would that we had a hundred men like-minded
with him touching this work!</p>

<p>Miss Anthony is obliged to relinquish
the care of the school at Petaluma, and is
succeeded by Miss Waterbury, whose Christian
spirit is not unknown at No. 56 Reade
St., New York. This school is quite
small, but its members surpass those of
every other school in liberality, and I cannot
consent to abandon them. Christ, too,
is becoming known to them. With increasing
interest they study God’s word.
And they <em>sing</em>, somewhat at random, it
must be confessed, in the matter of time
and of tune, but with an eagerness and a
gusto that betoken a beginning both of
the spirit and the understanding in their
song. Miss Anthony writes: “Wah Yene
is a good Christian as far as he understands.
He told me, one evening, that
he prayed ‘every morning, every dinnertime,
and every night. Some people,’ he
added, ‘not much good; likee go to
church; make Mr. Hutchins [the pastor
of the Congregational church] think
they good. Some people very good, and
pray to God. I likee be good&mdash;not much
bad.’”</p>

<h2>THE CHILDREN’S PAGE.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="center large">A TEACHER’S STORY.</p>

<p class="medium">The following letter is from a young girl who has
not gone through the Middle Class at Hampton,
but is showing much energy and tact, and doing
good work as teacher in one of the rough places
of the far South:</p>

<p class="right medium">FLORIDA.</p>

<p>I will first say, I am a colored girl;
my native home is in St. Augustine.
I was raised by kind Northern friends. I
am teaching school on the St. John’s River,
about thirty or forty miles from St. Augustine.
In giving my descriptions, I will first
describe my school-house. It is made entirely
of logs, with the exception of the
door and windows, which were given by
Miss M. The skies may be seen in any
part of the room. The cracks in the floor
are large enough to put your hands through.
When it rains, it leaks in like water dropping
from the trees. There is no fire-place,
nor was there any way for keeping warm
until, the past week, a young man got
me a little stove. But the house is so open
this does but little towards heating it up.
We have had some cold days, and the only
way I had to keep my scholars warm was,
to build two large fires and have the poor
little children set around them (out of
doors). I rubbed their little cold hands and
bare feet, and oh! how it made my heart
ache to see the tears stand in their eyes,
when I asked them why they didn’t put on
shoes and warmer clothes, and the reply
would be, “I have on all the clothes I got,
and I ain’t got no shoes.” Sometimes,
when I have on all I can to keep warm,
most of my girls have only two garments on,
the boys nothing but pants and shirt. Some
of my pupils have to come between two
and three miles, and then cross a creek. I
have a sewing-school for my girls once a
week. I read to them, and teach them
things to sing while they are sewing. They
are to keep what they make. I have been
teaching three-and-a-half months. The age
of my scholars is from three-and-a-half
to twenty-four years. I have enrolled
thirty scholars, most of them very good,
all anxious to learn. The people are
very, very poor, and have real hard
times in getting clothing, and keeping from
starving. They live in log huts, some of
which leak, and are in a dreadful condition.
I don’t know how to describe some of them.
There are a few white settlers here; some
of them, when the folks work for them,
won’t pay. This makes it real hard, as the
work they get from them is mostly their entire
support.</p>

<p class="center large">Incorporated January 30, 1849.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span> This Society shall be called “<span class="smcap">The American Missionary Association</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> The object of this Association shall be to conduct Christian missionary and
educational operations, and diffuse a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in our own and
other countries which are destitute of them, or which present open and urgent fields of
effort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> Any person of evangelical sentiments,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1">[A]</a> who professes faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ, who is not a slaveholder, or in the practice of other immoralities, and who
contributes to the funds, may become a member of the Society; and by the payment of
thirty dollars, a life member; provided, that children and others who have not professed
their faith may be constituted life members without the privilege of voting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> This Society shall meet annually, in the month of September, October or
November, for the election of officers and the transaction of other business at such time
and place as shall be designated by the Executive Committee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> The annual meeting shall be constituted of the regular officers and members
of the Society at the time of such meeting, and of delegates from churches, local missionary
societies, and other co-operating bodies&mdash;each body being entitled to one representative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> The officers of the Society shall be a President, Vice Presidents, a Recording
Secretary, Corresponding Secretaries, Treasurer, two Auditors, and an Executive
Committee of not less than twelve, of which the Corresponding Secretaries shall be advisory,
and the Treasurer ex-officio, members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> To the Executive Committee shall belong the collecting and disbursing of
funds; the appointing, counselling, sustaining and dismissing (for just and sufficient
reasons) missionaries and agents; the selection of missionary fields; and, in general, the
transaction of all such business as usually appertains to the executive committees of
missionary and other benevolent societies; the Committee to exercise no ecclesiastical
jurisdiction over the missionaries; and its doings to be subject always to the revision of
the annual meeting, which shall, by a reference mutually chosen, always entertain the
complaints of any aggrieved agent or missionary; and the decision of such reference
shall be final.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee shall have authority to fill all vacancies occurring among
the officers between the regular annual meetings; to apply, if they see fit, to any State
Legislature for acts of incorporation; to fix the compensation, where any is given, of all
officers, agents, missionaries, or others in the employment of the Society: to make provision,
if any, for disabled missionaries, and for the widows and children of such as are
deceased; and to call, in all parts of the country, at their discretion, special and general
conventions of the friends of missions, with a view to the diffusion of the missionary

<h5>FOOTNOTE:</h5>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1">[A]</a>
By evangelical sentiments, we understand, among others, a
belief in the guilty and lost condition of all men without a
Saviour; the Supreme Deity, Incarnation and Atoning Sacrifice
of Jesus Christ, the only Saviour of the world; the necessity
of regeneration by the Holy Spirit, repentance, faith and holy
obedience in order to salvation; the immortality of the soul; and
the retributions of the judgment in the eternal punishment of the
wicked, and salvation of the righteous.</p>

<h2><i>The American Missionary Association.</i></h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>AIM AND WORK.</h3>

<p>To preach the Gospel to the poor. It originated in a sympathy with the almost
friendless slaves. Since Emancipation it has devoted its main efforts to preparing the
<span class="smcap">Freedmen</span> for their duties as citizens and Christians in America and as missionaries in
Africa. As closely related to this, it seeks to benefit the caste-persecuted <span class="smcap">Chinese</span> in
America, and to co-operate with the Government in its humane and Christian policy
towards the <span class="smcap">Indians</span>. It has also a mission in <span class="smcap">Africa</span>.</p>


<h3>STATISTICS.</h3>

<h3>WANTS.</h3>

<p>1. A steady <span class="smcap">Increase</span> of regular income to keep pace with the growing work in the
South. This increase can only be reached by <em>regular</em> and <em>larger</em> contributions from the
churches&mdash;the feeble as well as the strong.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Additional Buildings</span> for our higher educational institutions, to accomodate the
increasing numbers of students; <span class="smcap">Meeting Houses</span>, for the new churches we are organizing;
<span class="smcap">More Ministers</span>, cultured and pious, for these churches.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Help for Young Men</span>, to be educated as ministers here and missionaries to
Africa&mdash;a pressing want.</p>

Association; to Life Members; to all clergymen who take up collections for the

Will and Testament, are earnestly requested to use the following:</p>


<h3>FORM OF A BEQUEST.</h3>

<p>“I <span class="medium">BEQUEATH</span> to my executor (or executors) the sum of &mdash;&mdash; dollars in trust, to pay
the same in &mdash;&mdash; days after my decease to the person who, when the same is payable,
shall act as Treasurer of the “American Missionary Association,” New York City, to be
applied under the direction of the Executive Committee of the Association, to its
charitable uses and purposes.”</p>

<p>The Will should be attested by three witnesses [in some States three are required&mdash;in
other States only two], who should write against their names, their places of residence
[if in cities, their street and number]. The following form of attestation will
answer for every State in the Union: “Signed, sealed, published and declared by the
said [A.B.] as his last Will and Testament, in presence of us, who, at the request of
the said A.B., and in his presence, and in the presence of each other, have hereunto subscribed
our names as witnesses.” In some States, it is required that the Will should
be made at least two months before the death of the testator.</p>

an established character for integrity and thrift
that constitute them valued customers in all

are accustomed to the "<span class="medium">RULES</span>" of the best Newspapers,

superior printing, with <b>no extra charge for

which add greatly to the appearance and effect of
business announcements.</p>

<p>We are, thus far, gratified with the success of this

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
